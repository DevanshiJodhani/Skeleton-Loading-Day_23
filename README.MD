# Hello world

## Just a simple example

Imagine you are visiting a video streaming website, and you click on a video you want to watch. instead of waiting for the entire video to load before showing anything on the screen, the website uses skeleton loading would be the technique used to display a placeholder layout while the "video" content is being loaded behind the scenes. By doing so, users are not presented with a blank screen or long loading times, but instead, they see a rough layout of what's to come, and as the real content loads, it gradually replaces the placeholders.
